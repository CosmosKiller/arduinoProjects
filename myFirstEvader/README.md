#  :house::policeman: Surveillance Autonomous Robot :camera::robot:

The idea is simple, I live alone so when I leave my home for a long period of time, say for vacations, there are some potential risks; Someone breaking into it and stealing my stuff, a gas loss or even my little feline friend getting out of control. 

So, making a little robot that wanders around the house (Some could say it's like the brand new Amazon Astro) can actually, be a good idea. Endowing it with couple of sensors, a camera and even a robotic arm, might help me to be a little calmer about whats going on when I'm not at home.

> _**Breif comment here:**_ By the time I'm writing this (10/04/2021), this might be my most ambicious project. In fact is my first personal project in which i'll apply all the knowlege gatherd through out the time i've been studying at Platzi.

- This early stage of the development is done with Arduino, because it's the most reliable prototyping platform, in my personal opinion. It's pretty accessible, easy to test and can handle pretty solid code. For this first block, I'm triying to make a functional obstacle evader bot; Simple, but it'll set the foundation for further and more complex development.

### To summarize, I'd love to recibe feedback and tips, so feel free to do it. This project is, above all, a personal challenge and a quest to develop myself as a professional.
